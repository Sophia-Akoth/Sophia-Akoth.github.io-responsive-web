	<h2>FACTS ABOUT BOOTS</h2>
	<p>A fashion boot is a boot worn for reasons of style or fashion (rather than for utilitarian purposes – e.g. not hiking boots, riding boots, rain boots, etc.). The term is usually applied to women's boots. Fashion boots come in a wide variety of styles, from ankle to thigh-length, and are used for casual, formal, and business attire. Although boots were a popular style of women's footwear in the Nineteenth Century, they were not recognized as a high fashion item until the 1960s. They became widely popular in the 1970s and have remained a staple of women's winter wardrobes since then.</p>

	<h2>FACTS ABOUT STILETTOS</h2>
	<p>What's often overlooked is that the stiletto was also a pivotal moment in the history of material science—that beautiful, applied stepchild of the master discipline physics—and engineering. Whether they credit André Perugia, Roger Vivier, or Salvatore Ferragamo, experts agree this particular heel, named for an Italian dagger with which it shares its sinewy shape, could never have been realized without desire, creativity, and steel. Where the much-maligned heel is going, however, is anyone's guess.</p>

	<h2>FACTS ABOUT SNEAKERS</h2>
	<p>Sneaker is a term that has become very common among people these days as they use it for sports shoes as if it is a synonym for them. People refer to all sorts of shoes with rubber soles as sneakers though it is not correct. The reason why these shoes got their name was because they made very little noise while walking because of their rubber soles. You could sneak up to someone else while wearing these shoes and hence the name.</p>
